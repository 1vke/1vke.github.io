# Hello, I'm Lucas 👋

I am a software engineer and Computer Science student at Ball State University, based in Muncie, Indiana. 

I have a passion for understanding how things work, whether that’s building scalable applications, modding game consoles, or diving into the nuances of offensive cybersecurity. I love the process of taking complex systems, breaking them down, and refining them into something better.

## What I Do

By day, I am a Mobile and Desktop Applications Software Engineer at **Sweetwater Sound**. I work primarily with **Swift** and **Kotlin** (and occasionally Objective-C) to build retail mobile applications and mobile or desktop internal tools that power the business.

Previously, I built web-based solutions for Ball State University mostly using the **AdonisJS** framework and **React**.

While I am comfortable with a wide stack, including Python, TypeScript, and Java, I am looking for non-work related opportunities to dive deeper into low-level languages like **C** and **C++**.

## Beyond the Code

When I’m not in a text editor, I am likely tinkering with hardware. I enjoy taking tech and giving it a second life through repair and modding. This hands-on curiosity feeds into my interest in cybersecurity; I am constantly exploring offensive security research to understand vulnerabilities from the inside out.

Outside of technology completely, you can find me skateboarding or exploring the outdoors.

## Get in Touch

I am always open to discussing software, security, or just general tech stuff. I am not currently looking for a job right now.
