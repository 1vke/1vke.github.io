# Digital Corps Website

One of my first major assignments at the Digital Corps was a project I took great pride in: rebuilding our own website. Since the site represents the Corps itself, I felt a deep sense of responsibility to make it look and perform its best. The challenge was to create a seamless experience by weaving together multiple systems—a WordPress backend for content and our in-house API for team data.

This project was a fantastic lesson in collaboration. I worked across the full stack, from implementing complex, responsive designs for the Staff and Team pages to enhancing our backend. On the backend, I modified our WordPress plugin to make content management easier for our communications team and added new API methods to filter employee data for features like an alumni page. This required constant communication with our UX and design teams to ensure my work was not only technically sound but also true to their vision. There were even times I helped rework designs to make them more feasible from a development perspective, which taught me a lot about bridging the gap between design and implementation.

More than just a technical task, this project pushed me to grow as a developer. I learned the importance of careful planning, especially when dealing with complex CSS for floating elements and non-traditional shapes. It was a masterclass in building reusable components and understanding how different parts of an application—frontend, backend, and API—fit together.

The project was eventually paused to address other priorities, and I have since moved on from my role at the Digital Corps. Still, it remains a formative experience that taught me invaluable lessons in coding practices, teamwork, and communication—skills that I carry with me in my work today.
