# Inventory Management System

![Inventory management system](/portfolio/inventory-management/thumbnail.png)

This project is what I consider the true beginning of my software development journey. During my senior year of high school, my teacher encouraged me to tackle something beyond the standard curriculum. I decided to build a web-based inventory management system from scratch, even though I had no prior experience with the web framework or databases I’d need to use.

The goal was to create a tool that could scan a barcode, pull up an item's data, and generate reports. The challenge was immense, but over six weeks, I dove headfirst into learning on the fly. It was my first time taking a project through its entire lifecycle: from a simple idea, through planning and late-night coding sessions, to finally deploying it and seeing it somewhat used in a real-world setting.

More than just learning a new framework or how to interact with a database, this project taught me how to problem-solve under pressure. I learned to break down a large, intimidating goal into manageable pieces and how to find answers when I was completely stuck. It was a crash course in the realities of development, where the perfect plan rarely survives first contact with the code.

Looking back, the code is far from perfect, the project is probably riddled with bugs and vulnerabilities, and I would architect it very differently today. But that’s not the point. The real victory was building something functional that solved a real problem. It was an incredibly rewarding experience that solidified my passion for creating solutions. Seeing something I built make an impact, however small, gave me the confidence to pursue software development seriously and tackle the bigger challenges that have led me to where I am today.
