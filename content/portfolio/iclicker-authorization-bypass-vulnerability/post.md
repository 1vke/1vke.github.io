My curiosity about how web applications secure their data led me to take a closer look at the iClicker platform, a tool used for classroom attendance. I wanted to understand how it verified a student's physical location. What I found was a fascinating lesson in web security.

I started by probing the location-based attendance feature. When a student tried to join a session from outside the designated area, the app would correctly deny access. But in its response, the server sent back the exact latitude and longitude of the classroom. This was the key. Instead of just showing a static map, the application was handing over the very data it was trying to protect. This meant anyone could capture these coordinates from a single failed attempt and reuse them to join the session from anywhere, no special tools required.

To take it a step further, I noticed the web app was built on an outdated version of Angular. This old version exposed a global `angular` object in the browser's developer console, creating a perfect entry point to manipulate the application's behavior. I decided to write a proof-of-concept script to demonstrate the full potential of the vulnerability.

Using the exposed Angular object, my script automated the entire process. It would intercept the app's location requests, feed it the captured classroom coordinates, automatically join the session as soon as it became available, and even answer poll questions with a random choice. It was a powerful demonstration of how a few seemingly small oversights could completely undermine a core security feature.

This project was conducted purely for educational purposes, and it was an eye-opening experience. It taught me that security should never be an afterthought. Simple decisions, like returning exact coordinates instead of a static image or failing to update a framework, can create significant vulnerabilities. This deep dive into security loopholes was rewarding and solidified my interest in both offensive security research and the principles of secure software development.
